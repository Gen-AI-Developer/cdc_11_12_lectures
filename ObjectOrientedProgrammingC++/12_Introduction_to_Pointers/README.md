# 12_Introduction_to_Pointers

This folder introduces the fundamental concepts of pointers in C++.

## Examples:

1.  **Pointer Declaration and Initialization**: Demonstrates how to declare pointer variables and initialize them with addresses of other variables.
2.  **Dereferencing Pointers**: Shows how to access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by a pointer.
3.  **Pointers and Arrays**: Illustrates the close relationship between pointers and arrays.
4.  **Pointer Arithmetic**: Examples of performing arithmetic operations on pointers.
5.  **Pointers to Pointers**: Demonstrates double pointers (pointers that point to other pointers).
6.  **Null Pointers**: Explains null pointers and their importance for safety.
7.  **Dynamic Memory Allocation (new and delete)**: Introduces `new` and `delete` operators for managing memory on the heap.
