# 10_Functions_passing_arguments_and_returning_values

This folder contains detailed examples demonstrating different ways of passing arguments to functions and returning values from them in C++.

## Examples:

1.  **Pass by Value**: Illustrates how arguments are copied to function parameters.
2.  **Pass by Reference**: Shows how to pass arguments by reference, allowing functions to modify original variables.
3.  **Pass by Pointer**: Demonstrates passing arguments as pointers, also allowing modification of original variables.
4.  **Returning by Value**: Examples of functions returning copies of values.
5.  **Returning by Reference**: Shows functions returning a reference to a variable.
6.  **Returning by Pointer**: Illustrates functions returning a pointer.
