# 11_function_overloading

This folder provides more detailed examples and scenarios for function overloading in C++.

## Examples:

1.  **Overloading with Different Number of Parameters**: Functions with the same name but varying argument counts.
2.  **Overloading with Different Data Types**: Functions with the same name but different types of parameters.
3.  **Overloading with Const and Non-Const Parameters**: Demonstrates overloading based on const-ness of parameters.
4.  **Overloading with Reference and Value Parameters**: Shows how overloading works with references vs. values.
5.  **Ambiguity in Overloading**: Examples of situations that can lead to compilation errors due to ambiguous function calls.
