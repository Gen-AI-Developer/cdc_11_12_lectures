# Types of Pointers in C++

This folder contains examples demonstrating different types of pointers in C++:

1. **Null Pointer**: A pointer that does not point to any memory location.
   - File: `null_pointer.cpp`

2. **Dangling Pointer**: A pointer that points to a memory location that has been deallocated or is out of scope.
   - File: `dangling_pointer.cpp`

3. **Wild Pointer**: An uninitialized pointer that points to a random memory location.
   - File: `wild_pointer.cpp`

4. **Smart Pointer**: A pointer that automatically manages the memory of the object it points to.
   - File: `smart_pointer.cpp`

Each example illustrates the concept and provides insights into best practices and potential pitfalls when working with pointers in C++.
