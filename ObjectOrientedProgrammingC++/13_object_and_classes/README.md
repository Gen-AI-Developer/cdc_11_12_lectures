# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This folder contains detailed explanations and examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The content is structured to guide college students from basic to advanced OOP concepts.

## Topics Covered:

### 1. Introduction to Classes and Objects
- **Definition**: Classes are user-defined data types, and objects are instances of classes.
- **Examples**: Defining and using classes and objects.

### 2. Members of a Class
- **Data Members**: Variables that hold data.
- **Member Functions**: Functions that operate on data members.
- **Access Specifiers**: `public`, `private`, `protected`.
- **Examples**: Demonstrating each concept.

### 3. Data Handling and Data Classes
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and functions into a single unit.
- **Data Classes**: Classes designed to handle data.
- **Examples**: Data handling and encapsulation.

### 4. Constructors and Destructors
- **Constructors**: Special member functions to initialize objects.
- **Destructors**: Special member functions to clean up resources.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Multiple constructors with different parameters.
- **Examples**: User-defined constructors, destructors, and overloading.

### 5. Accessing Members
- **Objects**: Used to access data members and member functions.
- **Examples**: Demonstrating object usage.

### 6. Advanced OOP Concepts
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism to derive new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to take many forms (e.g., function overloading, overriding).
- **Examples**: Single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance; function overloading and overriding.

Each topic is explained with examples to ensure clarity and understanding.
