# 05_Loops_in_CPP

This folder contains examples demonstrating various looping constructs in C++.

## Examples:

1.  **For Loop**: Basic `for` loop for iterating a fixed number of times.
2.  **While Loop**: `while` loop for iterating as long as a condition is true.
3.  **Do-While Loop**: `do-while` loop, which executes the loop body at least once.
4.  **Nested Loops**: Demonstrates loops inside other loops, often used for 2D structures or patterns.
5.  **Break and Continue**: Illustrates the use of `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip the current iteration.
6.  **Range-based For Loop (C++11)**: Modern `for` loop for iterating over collections.
